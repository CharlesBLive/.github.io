            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a passionate and detail-oriented Software Engineer based in Renton, WA, with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Bellevue College. I specialize in software development, IT systems administration, and technical problem-solving. My hands-on experience includes developing games in Unity/C#, providing enterprise IT support, and contributing to cloud-based solutions using AWS and SQL. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean, efficient code and thrive in collaborative, Agile environments. Whether solving user challenges, streamlining operations, or developing innovative features, I am driven by a commitment to continuous learning and delivering high-quality work. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring indie game development, disc golfing, or catching a football or hockey game. I'm passionate about technology’s power to create positive change and excited to be part of building solutions that make a difference.</p>
